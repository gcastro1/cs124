* Our design decisions:
    * We decided to design a minimalist task list because we wanted it to be easy to use and view.
    * We also wanted to (somewhat) emulate a classic paper check list so we included checkboxes and strikethrough upon checking the task.
    * The button colors were changed to be less straining on the eyes; The blue-green buttons indicate creation and edit buttons (for tasks and lists while the red buttons indicate deletion buttons 


* Alternative designs:
    * We wanted to have it so that the completed tasks would disappear from the screen upon checking it off. We scrapped the idea because creating that function was more complicated than we anticipated.


* Any user testing you did 
    * User testing was last done by two partcipants in the lab 3 iteration of the app.
    * No user testing done for lab 4 


* Final design & Flow:

  ![Start page](https://github.com/gcastro1/cs124/blob/lab4/Lab4%20Initial%20Screen.png)
  * The start page has a textbox and a button to select create a list.
  ![Final Design](https://github.com/gcastro1/cs124/blob/lab4/Lab%204%20Task%20List%20Screen.png)
  * Our final design has menus at the top to select existing lists and how tasks should be sorted.
  * Below that, there are te tasks for that list which can be edited, and marked as completed. 
  * At the bottom, tasks can be created or completed tasks can be hidden or cleared.
  * At the very bottom, new lists can be created or the current list that the user is on can be deleted

* Challenges we faced 
    * Learning how to use collection and subcollection (accessing data, editing data, etc.)



* Parts of the design we're most proud of:

    * We were proud of the strikethrough on checked items. It was a pretty creative idea by Giovanni.

    * We were also proud of the edit buttons we made to give the user a feeling of control over their tasks.

    * We were also proud of the edit buttons we made to give the user a feeling of control over their tasks.
    * We were proud of the addition of number of tasks so sighted and non-sighted alike can have a sense of how many tasks are on their list
